    "\"#### Primary tasks (must-have)\\n\",\n",
    "- [ ] Load the NF-UNSW-NB15-v3 dataset (or skip if confirmed pre-cleaned) and log basic stats via `df.shape`/`df.info()`.\n",
    "- [ ] Define target label column (e.g., Label/attack_cat) and confirm class imbalance (value_counts(normalize=True)).\n",
    "- [ ] Double Check for nulls, duplicates, and obvious inconsistencies; visualize any anomalies (e.g., `df.isna().sum().plot(kind=\"bar\")`).\n",
    "- [ ] Validate types: convert numeric columns, standardize categorical dtypes, fix malformed values.(It means “make sure every column is stored in the correct data type, and the values are clean enough that pandas/models don’t misinterpret them.”)\n",
    "- [ ] Split data using Stratified Sampling to ensure the train/validation/test sets maintain the same percentage of rare attack classes as the original data\n",
    "- [ ]  Check feature correlations; remove/merge highly correlated columns to reduce redundancy and leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"#### Secondary tasks (second essentials)\\n\",\n",
    "- [ ] Produce a quick EDA snapshot (pairplot/histograms) so downstream teams know the distribution shifts.\n",
    "- [ ] Keep/train/val/test split artifacts (70/15/15) deterministic—Tip: reuse a shared `RANDOM_STATE` when calling `train_test_split`. (example: RANDOM_STATE = 42 guarantees deterministic pseudo-random numbers, so every train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, etc., yields the exact same rows each run. Set it before splitting and pass it into every splitter/model that accepts random_state; otherwise splits change between runs and comparisons become inconsistent.)\n",
